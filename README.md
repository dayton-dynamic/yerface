# Learn Python with Yer Face

Conceived as a JupyterLite demo, this has run afoul of JupyterLite's 
out-of-date `pillow` version (has 10.2, need 11.0).  For the moment, 
you have two ways available to run the notebooks.

## On your own machine

This requires installing Python, Jupyter Lab, and Pillow.  If you 
know how to do all that... are you sure you should be taking an 
introductory Python tutorial?

## On Google Collab

My apologies for directing you to a commercial service.

Sign in to [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and 
work through as many of these as you have the inclination to!

Instead of using the direct links, you can...

Under "Open notebook", choose "GitHub", and enter
